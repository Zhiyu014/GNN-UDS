Multiple runs with different initial values
At non-overflow/flood scenarios, the main objective is to maximize the WWTP inflow, in which the current setting usually leads to the optimum.
At overflow/flood scenarios, the main objective is to minimize overflow, in which multiple initial values are necessary as there are many local minimas.

Need to do some analyses on the iteration processes if the assumptions above are correct.
Find the best initial value for iterations at different scenarios.

Determine if it is necessary to split flood/non-flood scenarios to apply different pop sizes.
Decide proper population size.
